changes: 
  - tweak: Made rare materials more common as part of mechanic costs.
  - tweak: Added plastic cost to all mechanic designs. You can get more from cargo or botany.
  - tweak: Reverted to the old system of item scanning temporarily. Guns are still unscannable except by traitors, but the old system is in place for balance testing.
  - rscadd: Flatpacks now come with instructions and a step list. They have a rare chance of a misprint, but this shouldn't be a major issue.
